  <h2 class="text-primary">General Questions</h2>

  <h5 id="download-and-edit">How can I download and edit the cartograms generated on this website?</h5>

  <p class="mx-4">Below each map or cartogram displayed on this website there is a download button. By
    clicking it, you can download an SVG image containing the map. SVG files contain vector images, and can
    be edited and converted by Adobe Illustrator or <a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, a free,
    open source alternative. If you would simply like to convert your SVG map to a PNG image to use in a
    document or paper and don’t have access to these programs, you can use <a href="https://svgtopng.com">this
      website</a>.</p>

  <h5 id="share-cartogram">Can I share images created by go-cart.io with others?</h5>

  <p class="mx-4">Yes. Images generated by <a href="https://go-cart.io">go-cart.io</a> can be distributed

  <h2 class="text-primary">Cartogram Generation</h2>

  <h5 id="what-kind-of-data">What kind of data are suited for generating cartograms?</h5>

  <p class="mx-4">Cartograms are designed to visualize totals, not indices. In general, if it is
    appropriate to use a pie chart or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_plot">mosaic plot</a> to
    visualize a dataset, then it should also be appropriate to use a cartogram. You can refer to the
    examples of appropriate and inapropriate datasets for use with cartograms below for more guidance:</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered mx-4">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>
          Appropriate
        </th>
        <th>
          Inapropriate
        </th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Total GDP by region
        </td>
        <td>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index" target="_blank">Human Development Index</a>
          (or similar composite statistics)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Total population by region
        </td>
        <td>
          Population density by region
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Number of college gradates by region
        </td>
        <td>
          Percentage of population that are college graduates by region
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p class="mx-4">For some data, the algorithm may not be able to compute a solution. For more
    information, please see our answer to <a href="#what-went-wrong">“What went wrong?”</a></p>

  <h5 id="upload-boundary">How can I upload my boundary file? Why it doesn't show anything?</h5>

  <p class="mx-4">Please upload your boundary file with valid geometries. Ensure there are no self-intersections; you
    can use tools like <a href="https://mapshaper.org/" target="_blank">Mapshaper</a> to check and resolve such issues.

    After uploading, the system will extract properties from the boundary file. Only properties with unique values can
    be used as region names. For example, in a world map where 'country_names' are used as region names, Indonesia—an
    archipelago with many separate islands—should be represented as a 'MultiPolygon' rather than multiple 'Polygon'
    objects.

    Only when the region names are identified can go-cart.io generate a spreadsheet with numeric data for each region.
  </p>

  <h5 id="fill-data">How to fill in the data?</h5>

  <p class="mx-4">After defining your map, go-cart.io will generate a spreadsheet for filling in the data. You have two
    options to fill or modify the data:</p>

  <ol class="mx-4">
    <li>Web Interface: Edit directly on our website.</li>
    <li>Download Data: Edit on your device using a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="mx-4">In either method, you'll see the following columns:</p>

  <ul class="mx-4">
    <li><b>Region</b>: Unique identifier for each region. Cannot be blank or duplicated.</li>
    <li><b>RegionLabel</b>: Text for each region. Can be blank. Text is scaled down or removed based on the region's
      area.</li>
    <li><b>Color</b>: Color for each region when 'Custom' color scheme is selected. Can be blank.</li>
    <li><b>ColorGroup</b>: Color for each region when other color schemes are selected.</li>
    <li><b>Inset</b>: Inset for each region. </li>
    <li><b>Geographic Area (sq. km)</b>: Calculated Geographic Area of each region. You can remove it to hide the
      original map
      in
      the visualization.</li>
    <li><b>Data column (unit)</b>: Data for each region to generate a cartogram. In the CSV file, the
      unit should be in parentheses after the data name</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mx-4">Important Notes:</p>

  <ul class="mx-4">
    <li>Do not modify the headers "Region," "RegionLabel," "Color," "ColorGroup," and "Inset" as the application may not
      work correctly.</li>
    <li>You can modify values in all columns except "Region." To change "Region" values, upload a custom boundary file
      (GeoJSON or Shapefiles) with prefered region values.</li>
    <li>You may add multiple data columns. Modify headers, change values, or delete headers as needed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 id="map-color">How can I change the map colors? What is ColorGroup in the downloaded CSV file?</h5>

  <p class="mx-4">You can select a color scheme from the left panel under "Color." Each region will automatically be
    assigned a color based on the chosen scheme. Alternatively, choose "Custom" and click on a box in the "Color" column
    to select a color from the pop-up panel.</p>

  <p class="mx-4">If you prefer to edit on your device, download the CSV file and use the hexadecimal color code format
    in the "Color" column. Learn more about this format
    <a href="https://appendto.com/2017/02/rgb-to-hex-understanding-the-major-web-color-codes/">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p class="mx-4">If you haven"t selected custom colors before downloading, you"ll find a "ColorGroup" column instead of
    "Color." Regions with the same "ColorGroup" will have the same color based on the chosen scheme. You can edit values
    in the "ColorGroup" as needed. Note that if the "Color" column is not empty, the visualization will use the "Color"
    column and ignore "ColorGroup."
  </p>

  <h5>What is inset?</h5>

  <p class="mx-4">An inset helps display regions that are geographically separated from the main area, like islands.
    Regions with different insets are processed separately and then combined based on the position defined in the
    "Inset" column.
  </p>

  <p class="mx-4">We support 5 positions for insets: "C" (center), "L" (left), "R" (right), "T" (top), and "D" (down).
    If no position is entered, the default is "C."
  </p>

  <h5 id="cartogram-generation-time">How long does it take to generate a cartogram?</h5>

  <p class="mx-4">It usually takes just a few seconds to generate one cartogram using this website. It will take longer
    if you have multiple data columns. A progress bar will give you an indication of how far the calculation has already
    proceeded. If you can’t see a cartogram at the end, please <a href="#what-went-wrong">read our answer</a> to “what
    went wrong?”
  </p>

  <h5 id="cartogram-generation-process">How does this website generate cartograms?</h5>

  <p class="mx-4">This website uses the Fast Flow-based method developed by Michael T. Gastner, Vivien
    Seguy, and Pratyush More. You can learn more about how this method works by reading
    <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/10/E2156">the paper</a> they published in the journal
    PNAS. If you publish an image produced by <a href="https://go-cart.io">go-cart.io</a>, please include a
    reference to the PNAS paper.
  </p>

  <h5 id="what-went-wrong">The website didn’t produce a cartogram. What went wrong?</h5>

  <p class="mx-4">
    Have you tried to make a small
    region very large? For example, did you set the objective area of the Vatican City as large as the
    objective area of Russia? Or did you give a large region an objective area of zero? If yes, the
    algorithm will struggle with the severe distortions that would be necessary to show the data as a
    cartogram. In that case, a cartogram may not be the best way to represent your data. Please also see our
    answer to <a href="#what-kind-of-data">“What kind of data are suited for generating cartograms?”</a>
